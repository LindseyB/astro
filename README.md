## Example outputs

### Horoscope

```
Today’s vibe: 🔥🦁 Moody but bold—emotions are deep, but don’t be afraid to shine your true self!

Do:
- Hang with friends or do something creative 🎨
- Reflect on your feelings but don’t get stuck in them 🤔
- Try something new or quirky that makes you stand out 🌈

Don’t:
- Start intense convos with family (could get dramatic) 🥲
- Overshare secrets or dig too deep today 🕵️‍♀️
- Expect work/tasks to go perfectly (Mercury rx chaos) 💻

Song: Midwest Pen Pals – “Movies Like Juno” 🎸
Beverage: Iced matcha latte—refreshing but comforting like Cancer season, with that Leo pop 💚🤩
```

### Full Chart

```
🦀🌙✨ Deep feels and empathy (Sun in Cancer 12H) but secretly—total softie, kinda mysterious, lowkey psychic.
🦁👑🔥 Big Leo rising energy—charisma! Venus in 1H = gorgeous vibes and main character moments, even if you’re shy inside.
🧠🌊 Moon in Aquarius 7H = quirky, unique tastes in friends/love. Needs independence in relationships, loves the oddballs.
💪🏽🏆 Mars/Neptune in Capricorn (6H): hardworking, dreamy realist, but also risk of burnout from helping everyone.
🎢 Uranus/Saturn in 5H = creative rebel but needs structure; probs has some weird hobbies or unconventional romantic adventures.
🦂🏠 Pluto in 4H = deep family stuff, possible emo backstory. Transformation happens at home.
💔🗣️ Chiron in 11H = past friendship hurts, longing for your soul tribe.
🌧️🎸 Overall theme: sensitive outsider with a fierce heart, balancing deep feels & eccentric social vibes.

🛏️ Song Rec: "Never Meant" by American Football fits your vibe perfectly!
```
